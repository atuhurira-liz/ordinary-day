# ordinary-day
how my normal ordinary day goes like
i wake up after three snoozes
check the time one more time
say a prayer as i lay in bed still lazy to get up
get my phone and check the time after i doze off again
get up and put water in the kettle to boil
wake up n go the bathroom to brush my teeth
