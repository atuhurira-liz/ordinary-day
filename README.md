# ordinary-day
how my normal ordinary day goes like
i wake up after three snoozes
check the time one more time
Atend meetings
say a prayer as i lay in bed still lazy to get up
read a portion of scripture
get my phone and check the time after i doze off again
get up and put water in the kettle to boil
i brush my hair
wake up n go the bathroom to brush my teeth
put some perfume on
get into the car and drive to work
ok
